# Newsweek clone: Bootstrap!

> In this project, I worked on making a whole website using the Bootstrap Framework. I worked on the elements we had seen previously such as Grid and Flexbox, and I included Media Queries to be able to make the website look exactly as the original for different screen sizes. I also worked with background images complete project that includes all the knowledge previously acquired and the Bootstrap classes.

The original website includes some responsive elements that needed some Javascript and JQueries to work so that I was not able to copy those with the exact functionality as in the original website.
